IMDB is one of the most popular movie rating site. Using IMDB data, my aim to to explore the different factors on which its revenue is dependent. Does the bidget play a major role? Does some genres are more hit than others? Does casting count...and so on. For the purpose of analysis, I have used dataset from Kaggle
